This program is written using PyCharm for Windows.

The main map is encoded into a class for each coordinate on the map.
Each cell class holds information like the neighboring cells and of what type they are and the type of each neighboring
cell - like . , ~ , O, X, U  for each of the N, S, E, W possible moves.  I refer to 'O' as a power outlet.

NOTE: The unittests are hooked hardcoded to test 0.txt.

To invoke the program on windows, cd to the root directory of the project and enter:
    python  src/main.py -i 0.txt

To execute the tests on Windows:
    python  -m unittest discover -s "C:\Users\desir\Documents\GitHub\challenge2\challenge2\tests\unit"
                                 -t "C:\Users\desir\Documents\GitHub\challenge2\challenge2"
                                 -p "Test_*.py"

To invoke the main program on Linux, cd to the main root code directory and enter
    python3 -m src.main -i 0.txt

To execute the unittests on Linux:
    python3 -m unittest discover -s /home/desiree2/Repositories/challenge2/tests/unit
                                 -t /home/desiree2/Repositories/challenge2
                                 "Test_*.py"

NOTE: There is one unittest in Test_CalledFunctions.py: Test_ListOfPowerOutlets which fails on
both Windows & Linux command line only, but passes in PyCharm on Windows & Linux. I don't know why yet.

I had started putting a doubly linked list for back-tracking of the robot but didn't have time to finish it.
