This program is written using PyChard for Windows.

The main map is encoded into a class for each coordinate on the map.
Each cell class holds information like the neighboring cells and of what type they are and the type of each neighboring
cell - like . , ~ , O, X, U  for each of the N, S, E, W possible moves.

I had started putting a doubly linked list for back-tracking of the robot but didn't have time to finish it.

To invoke to program, cd to the root directory of the project and enter:
    python  src/main.py -i 0.txt

To execute the tests on Windows:
python  -m unittest discover -s "C:\Users\desir\Documents\GitHub\challenge2\challenge2\tests\unit"
                             -t "C:\Users\desir\Documents\GitHub\challenge2\challenge2"
                             -p "Test_*.py"
